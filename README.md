Tasks: 

The following are the broad tasks to be performed:

*Load the data into your code

Keep 20% of the data aside as test data.

Apply the required preprocessing techniques on the data.

Apply different machine learning techniques.

Tune the parameters of models as required.

Build a model named ‘final_model’

Report the following metrics using ‘final_model’ on the test data:
    Accuracy
    F1-score
    Display the confusion matrix

Report the importance of different features.
